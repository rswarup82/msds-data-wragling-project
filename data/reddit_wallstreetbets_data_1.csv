I think usually your premium is gone when you buy the option. You can wait for it to expire in the money but a better way is to cash it out long before. If you buy a call way above the current price it will be cheap. If the price gets closer it will go up in value. So if it goes up you can make money by just selling. 

You just have to have it go up quickly. Every day the value of the call goes down in value, eventually to zero  if you are out of the money.

It will explode at some point and you are hoping there is another fool than will buy those calls from you.

To break even at expiration you have to be at the strike plus the premium you spent on the call. So a $880C probably needs to be mid $900s to break even.

Spend more and getting fewer options. A Sept $750 to maybe $800 seems reasonable and would still pay well.
